# Tapeout Course Task 1: Tools Installation and Video Summary

## Day 0: Video Summary
The Day 0 video of the tapeout course introduces the essential tools required for VLSI design and verification. The key points covered are:
- **Objective**: Setting up the environment for open-source VLSI design tools.
- **Tools Overview**:
  - **Yosys**: An open-source synthesis tool for converting HDL to netlists.
  - **Iverilog**: A Verilog simulation tool for verifying hardware designs.
  - **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer for analyzing simulation outputs.
  - **ngspice**: A circuit simulator for analog and mixed-signal designs.
  - **Magic**: A VLSI layout tool for physical design.
  - **OpenLANE**: An automated RTL-to-GDSII flow for chip design.
- **System Requirements**: Instructions for setting up a virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04+, 6GB RAM, 50GB HDD, and 4 vCPUs.
- **Tool Installation**: Step-by-step guide for installing the above tools, including dependencies and configurations.
- **Importance**: These tools form the foundation for the tapeout process, enabling simulation, synthesis, and physical design.
